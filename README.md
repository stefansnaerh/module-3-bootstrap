This is my first project using bootstrap.
I found it very useful and i can see how it can save alot of time. 
I did the youtube guide from NetNinja and then i made my own website from what i learned there and styled it similar to him.
When you click the Buy Now button you get to another page wich has a slide and buyer information.
I would like to make the slide/photo smaller but i had problems with connecting sass to my directory and decided to save that problem for later.
